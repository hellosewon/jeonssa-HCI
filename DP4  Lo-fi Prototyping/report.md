## Observation

Task | Observation
 --- | --- 
Accept/deny Roulette | 1. Too many pop-ups on a single screen in the last slide. (P1, low)
Spin Roulette | 2. Show roulette is spinnable (P2, high) <br> 3. User can't change decision once declining the roulette offer. (P1, high) <br> 4. Not sure where to see if I(user) have successfully completed the mission. (P1,P2, high) <br>  5. Where and when to get the incentive? (P1,P2, high)
Check menu | 6. Use better example of 'View Menu' screen. 상세보기 주문하기 look like buttons, but they aren't. (P1, high)
Call Waiter | 7. Wants to be notified if waiter is called correctly. (P2, high)
Physical | 8. Tablet takes up too much table space (P3, high) <br> 9. Very high possibility that user won't notice the pop-up if user puts tablet aisde. (P3, medium)
Mental | 10. Psychological pressure due to real time count down - unhealthy. (P1,P2, medium)

### Plans for Improvement (order corresponds to the list in table)
1) In the last prototype slide, consider removing pop-ups behind offer declined.
2) Feedback implemented in current version of prototype with hovering finger icon over the roulette to indicate roulette is spinnable.
3) Feedback implemented in current version of prototype with pop-up alarms stored in buttom right message icon.
4) Add a task that displays mission status.
5) Add a task that tells when and where to receive the incentive.
6) Include interactions with ‘주문하기, 상세보기’ buttons.
7) Feedback implemented in current version of prototype with ‘waiter has been called’ pop-up.
8) Make system compatible with  customer’s phone  to get rid of tablet.
9) Produce bip sound when an pop-up alerts.
10) Get rid of real time count down and tell whether the user has completed the mission or not after finish eating.
