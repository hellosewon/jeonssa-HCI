# Lo-fi Prototyping
 ![alt text](title.png "Title: Virtual Wheel-of-Fortune")

## POV

We met several restaurant owners and potential customers who have experienced or have trouble with long waiting line at a busy restaurant. 
We were amazed that one out of two customers leave because of the long waiting, and that customers get very frustrated while waiting when they have to wait indefinitely in a very uncomfortable place. 
It would be game changing to reduce amount of time each customers wait, and to provide customers with estimated waiting time with possible resting place.

## Studio Reflections

### FEEDBACK SUMMARY
1. Pop-up messages are overlapped so it seems a little bit noisy
2. Add some confirmation when you decide to accept a challenge
3. When calling a waiter, show some animation or status or time left for user can save time for unnecessary condition.
