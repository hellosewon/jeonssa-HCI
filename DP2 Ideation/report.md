# Ideation
 ![alt text](title.PNG "Title: Shorter Waiting Make Dining Out Great Again")
 
---
 
## Point of view
We met a restaurant owner.  
We were amazed to realize that one out of two customers leave because of waiting.  
We thought that it would be game-changing to drastically reduce the time his customers had to wait.

## Solution Ideas


### Encourage faster eating
1. Make slow eaters pay more
2. Enforce a time limit on eating  
3. Give discounts to fast eaters
4. Give coupons to fast eaters
5. Give desserts to fast eaters
6. Give slow eaters less food
7. Have menu prices that vary depending on time of day (expensive during peak hours, cheaper when business is slow)
8. Forbid customers from doing other things besides eating
9. Customers can only sit at tables once their food is ready
10. Create a competitive environment to encourage fast eating


### Make use of space
1. Remove tables completely (customers will eat sitting on the floor)
2. Let customers eat while standing
3. Make use of a food truck in peak hours
4. Let customers share the same table
5. Move the kitchen to another floor or other building (to make for more room)
6. Implement take-outs
7. Implement a food delivery system
8. Set up tables outside the restaurant
9. Customers can only sit at tables once their food is ready
10. Renovate restaurant to make for more room


### Productive waiting time
1. Prepare books or magazines to read
2. Give a discount depending on how long the customer had to wait
3. Waiter gives detailed explanation of menu items to waiting customers
4. Order from menu beforehand so that when a table becomes free the customer can start eating right away
5. Give a discount for next time when customer doesn’t get due to waiting
6. While waiting, encourage customer to advertise restaurant on SNS and get a free meal
7. Recommend other restaurants to go to
8. The customers prep food ingredients for their meals
9. Provide entertainment(e.g. a movie, TV, etc.) to waiting customers
10. Arrange a partnership with a nearby entertainment venue. (e.g, coffee shop, PC cafe, Karaoke)

## Top 3 Solutions  
Selection Process: Ideation on each HMW questions. Then we voted for the best. 
### Solution 1: Give Incentives to Fast Eaters
Why? Better than giving disadvantage to slow eaters.  

### Solution 2: Share Table
Why? This solution is very practical, and costs nothing. Very high effeciency.  


### Solution 3: Recommend Entertainment
Why? People visiting restaurants in an unfamiliar region don’t have info, so reduce the time searching for info and get right into entertainment so reduce the time searching for info and get right into entertainment

 ## Studio Reflections
 ### FEEDBACK SUMMARY
1) If the customers come as a group of 3, they wouldn't want to share the remaining spot with a random person. In a similar sense, a random customer would not be willing to join a group of random people. 
2) It would be nice to provide actual, accurate remaining waiting time
3) If the customer goes to recommended entertainment venues, customer could return early or late, resulting in either the customer waiting more, or the restaurant holding an empty table

### FEEDBACK REFLECTION
1) We will let customers join table only if they wish to, so that the customers won't feel forced to do so. Our understanding is that there are situations where customers must eat within a time constraint and thus don't mind eating with other people.
2) It is hard to estimate accurate remaining waiting time because people have different paces at which they eat, so we will provide the number of remaining waiting teams as an alternative measure
3) This problem could be handled by providing the customer exact remaining waiting time, but as already mentioned in the previous point, it is hard to do so for the reasons as explained. So the restaurant could recommend the customer to come back when a certain number of waiting teams are remaining.
