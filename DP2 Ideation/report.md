# Ideation
 ![alt text](title.PNG "Title: Shorter Waiting Make Dining Out Great Again")
 
## Point of view
We met a restaurant owner.  
We were amazed to realize that two in one customers left because of waiting.  
It’d be game-changing to drastically reduce the time customers have to wait.

## Persona
 ![alt text](nubjjugi.PNG "Figure1. Nubjjugi, the persona")
 
* Nubjjugi is a restaurant owner
* His situated in busy area, usually always full during busy hours
* Many customers have to wait
* Loses lots of potential business to waiting customers
* Has limited space available in dining area

### Nubjjugi’s Goals:
	1) Reduce customers’ waiting time
	2) Serve as many customers as possible

## Top 3 Solutions

### Solution 1: Give Incentives to Fast Eaters
How?  
Ideation on HMW encourage customers to eat faster? We voted for the best.  
Why?  
Better than giving disadvantage to slow eaters.  
(To encourage people to eat fast so that fewer people have to wait). 

### Solution 2: Share Table
How?  
Make full use of available seats in the restaurant  
Why?  
Waste of available dining area space, 
benefits customer by removing waiting their time


### Solution 3 : Recommend Entertainment
How?  
Make use of available sources near the restaurant. 
Why?  
People visiting restaurants in an unfamiliar region don’t have info,  
so reduce the time searching for info and get right into entertainment

 ## Studio Reflections
* group of 3, don't want to share -> owner of restaurant mediates
* 일찍 오거나 늦게 오거나 
* provide actual waiting time 
* 사용자 손해
