# Ideation
 ![alt text](title.PNG "Title: Shorter Waiting Make Dining Out Great Again")
 
## Point of view
	We met a restaurant owner.  
	We were amazed to realize that two in one customers left because of waiting.  
	It’d be game-changing to drastically reduce the time customers have to wait.

### Top 3 HMW
	How might we...  
	1) encourage customers to eat faster?  
	2) make use of all available tables (space)?  
	3) make waiting time more productive?  


## Solution Ideas


### Encourage faster eating
1. make slow eater to pay more
2. fixed eating time constraint
3. give discounts to fast eater
4. give coupons to fast eater
5. give desserts to fast eater
6. slow eaters get less amount of food
7. different cost assigned to differing eating time
8. forbid doing other things besides eating
9. customers can use table only if their food is ready
10. Make fast eating rank tournament


### Make use of space
1. remove table(sit on the floor)
2. let customer eat while standing
3. use food-truck in busy hour
4. let customers join table
5. move kitchen to another floor or other building
6. implement take-outs
7. implement delivery system
8. make tables outside the restaurant
9. customers can use table only if their food is ready
10. extend restaurant


### Productive waiting time
1. remove waiting time completely
2. discount depending on time customer had to wait
3. customer prepares own food
4. give incentive if waiting is long
5. discount next time when customer doesn’t get to eat this time
6. advertise restaurant on sns and get free food
7. recommend other restaurant
8. customer prepares food ingredients
9. provide entertainment(e.g. movie, show) to customers waiting
10. make partnership with nearby entertainment place. (e.g. cafe, pc cafe)


## Top 3 Solutions
### Solution 1: Give Incentives to Fast Eaters
	How?  
	Ideation on HMW encourage customers to eat faster? We voted for the best.  
	Why?  
	Better than giving disadvantage to slow eaters.  
	(To encourage people to eat fast so that fewer people have to wait). 

### Solution 2: Share Table
	How?  
	Make full use of available seats in the restaurant  
	Why?  
	Waste of available dining area space, 
	benefits customer by removing waiting their time


### Solution 3: Recommend Entertainment
	How?  
	What we considered most important is the actual practicality, and additional capital that needs to be invested for the solution. 
	Why?  
	We chose this solution because there actually are very famous restaurants in korea that forces customers share table, and in some european countries, costomers voluntarily does so. In addition, this solution costs nothing.

 ## Studio Reflections
	1) group of 3, don't want to share -> owner of restaurant mediates
	2) 일찍 오거나 늦게 오거나 
	3) provide actual waiting time 
	4) 사용자 손해
