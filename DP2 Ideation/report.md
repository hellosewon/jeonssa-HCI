## How Might We (HMW) Questions

## Top 3 HMW Questions

How might we…
* ...make use of all available tables (space)?
Sometimes we only see two people sit at 4-person tables, etc.
* ...encourage customers to eat faster?
Some people take SUPER LONG to eat...
* ...make waiting time more productive?
What if customers were free to go do other things during their waiting time?

## Solution Ideas

 Make use of space | Encourage faster eating | Productive waiting time
 --- | --- | --- 
Remove table(sit on the floor) | Make slow eater to pay more | Remove waiting time completely 
Let customer eat while standing | Fixed eating time constraint | Discount depending on time customer had to wait 
Use food-truck in busy hour | Give discounts to fast eater | Customer prepares own food
let customers join table | Give coupons to fast eater | Give incentive if waiting is long
Move kitchen to another floor or other building | Give desserts to fast eater | Discount next time when customer doesn’t get to eat this time
Implement take-outs | Slow eaters get less amount of food | Advertise restaurant on sns and get free food
Implement delivery system | Different cost assigned to differing eating time | Recommend other restaurant
Make tables outside the restaurant | Forbid doing other things besides eating |Customer prepares food ingredients
Customers can use table only if their food is ready | Customers can use table only if their food is ready | Provide entertainment(e.g. movie, show) to customers waiting
Extend restaurant | Make fast eating rank tournament | Make partnership with nearby entertainment place. (e.g. cafe, pc cafe)
