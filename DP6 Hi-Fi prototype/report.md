# Hi-fi Prototyping
 
---
## POV
    “A customer waiting for restaurant table needs to feel less fraustration
    because one out of two customers tends to leave tired of waiting.”
- User: A customer waiting for restaurant table. 
- Needs: Feel less fraustration. 
- Insights: One out of two customers tends to leave tired of waiting. 

We met several restaurant owners and potential customers who have experienced or have trouble with long waiting line at a busy restaurant. 
We were amazed that one out of two customers leave because of the long waiting, and that customers get very frustrated while waiting when they have to wait indefinitely in a very uncomfortable place. 
It would be game changing to reduce amount of time each customer has to wait, and to provide customers with estimated waiting time with possible resting place.

---
## Target Users

---
## Tasks
1. Join the waiting list (make a reservation)
2. Leave the waiting list (cancel reservation)

## Implementation Notes

### URL of Prototype: <a href="https://kmin93.github.io/jeonssa-HCI/" target="_blank">https://kmin93.github.io/jeonssa-HCI/</a>

### URL of Git repository: <a href="https://github.com/kmin93/jeonssa-HCI" target="_blank">https://github.com/kmin93/jeonssa-HCI</a>

### Libraries and frameworks: jQuery, Bootstrap

### Lessons from heuristic evaluation:

- Add a Help section to inform first-time users of the site's purpose and functionality
- Filter invalid values from information input sections (only numbers allowed)
- Match URLs to actual hyperlinks
- Disable the "remaining teams" progress bar from being able to be moved by users
- Match reservation number on cancel, reject otherwise
- Fix rule for phone number input
- Implement call function for restaurant
- Remove "cancel" icon in reservation cancellation
