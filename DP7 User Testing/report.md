## Studio Reflections

### FEEDBACK SUMMARY
1. User testing should be conducted in a more realistic situation, where participants are actually in a restaurant waiting line and in a hurry. The emotional states involved with the situation will affect the satisfaction of ui.
2. Why no training session?
3. Measure the number of trial & errors before successfully using a built in function
4. I recommend testing at least 6 participants to construct a justification of how fast a large number of people can comprehend the functions of UI.


### FEEDBACK REFLECTION
1. Reflected in written protocol - testing environment section; we tested user in busy restaurants
2. Reflected in written protocol - tutorial or training section
