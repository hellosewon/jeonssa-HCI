# User Testing

## Written Protocol

### Instructions for preparation
Imagine you are at a busy restaurant and there are already 7 teams in waiting line. Pretend that you arrived at the restaurant front desk where tablet PC is located. Tablet PC has following link opened with chrome browser: https://kmin93.github.io/jeonssa-HCI/ . You have to get in the line using this tablet PC. 
 
 
Web browser: user chrome<br>
URL: https://kmin93.github.io/jeonssa-HCI/

### Testing environment
1. Tester prepares tablet pc
2. User brings his cell phone
3. Testing will be done in a busy restaurant so that user actually feels he/she want
4. A place where both the user and the tester feel comfortable and quiet enough to conduct an interview
 
### Introduction and informed consent:
##### Introduction	
You are invited to take part in a user testing. The results of this test will provide some crucial information as to how we might improve our service. It is your choice if you want to participate in this user testing or not. This form explains both why we are conducting and what will happen during the user testing. This information will help you decide whether you want to participate in our user testing.
 
##### Purpose of the user testing
We are to launch a web-based service that provides estimated waiting time and enables joining/leaving waiting line in busy restaurants, so that customers don’t have to wait inside restaurants. We want to check whether we missed out any important tasks or have any kind of usability issues.  
 
##### What to expect during test
- Spend 5~10 minutes exploring the web like you normally would
- Answer as much as you can to our questionnaires/interview questions
- Provide Any suggestions for improvement (if you have any)
- We will record/capture screens and write notes 
 

### Tutorial or training:

###### Figure 1: Main screen for enqueuing.<br>

###### Figure 2: 'What does this site do?' tutorial pop-up.<br>


##### Tutorial:
We will offer a tutorial in the main page (Figure 1). Once  ‘What does this site do?’ is clicked a tutorial page (Figure 2) will pop up. It will serve the purpose of providing a quick view of the overall mechanism of our service

##### Training session:
- Task list & instruction: What are the tasks participants should perform, and what instruction should they be given? This is another part that should be delivered exactly as written to all participants.
- Recording strategy: How will you record your observations and findings? We advise against video recording, but instead recommend sketches, photos, voice recordings, screen captures, screen recordings, and written notes as you see fit. Also discuss what role members of your team will play in each session: facilitator, observer, and optionally tech person in charge of monitoring if the system is working fine and data is collected properly.
- Questionnaires, Interview questions: After the session, it's a good idea to get qualitative comments about the task experience from participants. In doing so, we suggest preparing a list of questions to ask in advance. For interviews, consider semi-structured format: follow the initial plan you came up with, but ask additional questions based on participants' responses.
- Debrief prompt: After the session, thank your participants and give them a short debrief about the experience and the project.

## Session Observations
- Participants are representative?
- Participant information is descriptive and contextual?
- Visual aids (photo or sketch) are added?
- Summary of each session is provided?

---
## Usability Lessons
- 10+ usability issues submitted?
- Are the usability issues described concretely and clearly?
- Organized by task and theme?
- Level of criticality included?
- High-level reflections are thoughtful and insightful?


---
## Plan for Iteration
- Is the plan for improvement reasonable and concrete?
- Are the goals well-justified?


---
## Studio Reflections

### FEEDBACK SUMMARY
1. User testing should be conducted in a more realistic situation, where participants are actually in a restaurant waiting line and in a hurry. The emotional states involved with the situation will affect the satisfaction of ui.
2. Why no training session?
3. Measure the number of trial & errors before successfully using a built in function
4. I recommend testing at least 6 participants to construct a justification of how fast a large number of people can comprehend the functions of UI.


### FEEDBACK REFLECTION
1. Reflected in written protocol - testing environment section; we tested user in busy restaurants
2. Reflected in written protocol - tutorial or training section
