# DP 8: Iteration & Wrap-up

Final Report: The final report will be brief. You need to simply include the following:
- Iteration: How did you spend the DP8 period for iteration? Why? What changes did you make? Show concrete examples and data whenever applicable. What did you learn?
During DP8 period, we put effort in improving our service by implementing the problmes that we identified from the DP7 Usability lessons. There were a total eleven DP7 Usability lessons, but we chose not to handle all the lessons because some of them were either too minor or too subjective (other users might not consider it as a problem). Instead, we decided to focus on usability lessons with high priority fix. The table below shows the list of usabliity lessons that we fixed.

|#|Issues|Theme|Level of Criticality|
|---|---|---|---|
|1|In the reservation page, the "See Menu" button does not work.|Consistency & standards|Major: high priority fix|
|2|Currently, the progress bar in the reservation page serves no purpose than to simulate functionality. It does not accurately reflect how many teams are actually waiting.|Consistency & standards|Major: high priority fix|
|3|On Android phones, the confirmation page for reservation cancellation is not mobile-friendly.|Consistency & standards|Major: high priority fix|
|4|It is hard to close the “Cancel Reservation” pop-up window - the X button to close is hard to see.|Visibility of system status|Major: high priority fix|
|5|The "What does this site do?" link is hard to see.|Aesthetic & minimalist design|Major: high priority fix|

Then we conducted two additional user testings in which we again identifed a few usability lessons. Some of them overlapped with the low priority DP7 Usability lessons such as "In the main page, keyboard input (on iPad) shows QWERTY keyboard, not numbers" and "Placeholders in the main page seems too verbose". Besides these, we identified one high priority usability lesson that wasn't in DP7, which is "help page x button disappears when moving position".

After implementing a series of iterations on user testing, we've learned that it is hard to develop a service that brings satisfaction to all users and that what we thought was good enough still had many usability problems to overcome.


- Individual reflection: Each member should write this part on their own, reflecting on their personal experience. Merge all members' mini-reports in the final report. Please answer the following questions:
    - What part of the UI implementation did you contribute to?
    - What worked well and not in your team? How did you overcome any hurdle in teamwork? What lesson about teamwork did you learn that you might apply to your next team project?
    - Throughout the team-based design project experience, what did you learn about the user-centered design process and web-based GUI implementation?
