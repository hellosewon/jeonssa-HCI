# Hi-fi Prototyping
 
---
## POV
    “A customer waiting for restaurant table needs to feel less fraustration
    because one out of two customers tends to leave tired of waiting.”
- User: A customer waiting for restaurant table. 
- Needs: Feel less fraustration. 
- Insights: One out of two customers tends to leave tired of waiting. 

We met several restaurant owners and potential customers who have experienced or have trouble with long waiting line at a busy restaurant. 
We were amazed that one out of two customers leave because of the long waiting, and that customers get very frustrated while waiting when they have to wait indefinitely in a very uncomfortable place. 
It would be game changing to reduce amount of time each customer has to wait, and to provide customers with estimated waiting time with possible resting place.
