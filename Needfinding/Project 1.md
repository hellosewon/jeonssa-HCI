Redesign how potential customers have to wait for seats in full restaurants during peak hours in busy areas.  
(such as 강남 or 둔산)

**OBSERVATION #1: “I don’t like waiting.”**

**Figure 2.** People don’t like waiting.

A university student was asked about the recent waiting experience in restaurants. He has had lots of dining experiences at busy places and hence was qualified as a “story-teller” of the experience we were trying to redesign. He insinuated a little frustration as he shouted “All the time!” when asked if he ever had to wait in restaurants. This confirms one statement: People don’t like waiting. [Here are the full notes taken from this interview.](#interview1)


**OBSERVATION #2: “Making customers wait is bad."**

**Figure 3.** Making customers wait is bad.

 We gently asked the restaurant manager for 2 minutes. He would give a valuable lesson about our redesigning experience as he had arbitrated a lot of waiting customers. He showed a wry smile when he said “One out of two tends to leave at busy hours”. This informs us one thing. Making customers wait is bad for restaurants too. [Here are the full notes taken from this interview.](#interview2)


**OBSERVATION #3: “I am willing to wait if you let me know until when.”**

**Figure 4.** Letting know  expected waiting time is good.

A young female pulled out a “waiting ticket” as the interview began. A self-proclaimed “foodie”, she had some interesting aspects to reveal regarding the experience we were planning to redesign. She decided to stay and wait in the restaurant after looking at the ticket written “대기인원: 1명”. This enlightened us with one thing: Letting know until when to wait is good. [Here are the full notes taken from this interview.](#interview3)

**OBSERVATION #4: “Causes unproductivity”**

**Figure 5. Valuable time is lost.**

Working in Gangnam, the two office workers could be the extreme users of our to-be-redesigned experience. They wait almost everyday but did not have a clear plan what to do while waiting. One surprising answer was "2 hours" to the question "What was the longest time of waiting?" We now know that waiting can cause unproductivity for some people. [Here are the full notes taken from this interview.](#interview4)


## Needs
From the interview, we observed some interesting moments and problems that they face.

For customers,  
* They have hard time estimating when their table will be ready.
* They do not want to jus tsit and wait for their turns.
* When the kitchen is too busy, they still had to wait for a long time, albeit while sitting
* They are willing to wait for a long time for a particular restaurants
* They are sensitive about giving out their personal information to the restaurant.

For restaurant owners,
* They get very frustrated when customer, for some reason (e.g. too shy), do not notify the restaurant when they want to cancel the reservation.

From these problems and interesting moments we found, we derived following needs for our interviewees.

For customer, they want to ...
* Be notified when their turns has come.
* Know how longer they have to wait.
* Be notified at an appropriate time. (e.g. "Seat be ready in 5 minutes")
* Get started eating as quickly as possible.
* Do something entertaining while waiting (e.g. shopping, go to cafe)
* Not provide too much personal information (e.g. phone number, name)

For restaurant owners, they want to ...
* Know when customers wants to cancel the reservation

Apart from the interesting moments listed above, through further brainstorming and interview, we derived following needs that our potential users face.

For customers, they want to ...
* Stay comfortable while waiting (e.g. avoid heat during summer, chill during winter)
* Not have to keep piece of paper with themselves all the time (paper ticket)

For restaurant owners, they want to
* Minimize the amount of labor required for managing waiting customers.
* Accommodate as many customers as possible.
* Be able to accurately estimate the expected waiting time for customers.

## Insights
From the above-mentioned interesting moments and problems, we also derived insights.

* Letting the customer know the expected waiting time increases the chance of holding the customer.
* Uncertain estimation of eating time leads to providing uncertain expected waiting time to customers.
* Clerk may find it difficult to estimate when the seats will become empty, thus hard to tell customers how many minutes are left.
* Current process of being seated is wasteful - clerk tells you there’s an empty seat→ get seated→ look at the menu→ calls the clerk→ order menu.
* People are more inclined to wait for restaurants that have a waiting list system, for which they are free to do other things during the waiting time.
* Customers want to provide minimal personal information.
* People are more inclined to wait for restaurants that they like/know, rather than for ones they haven’t been to before.
* Customers need a strong alarm that will draw attention while doing something else outside the restaurant.

Apart from the interesting moments listed above, through further brainstorming and interview, we derived following insights.

* People are foced to wait in the same area with strangers, feeling awkward
* Having a waiting list system is preferable in general; 
without a strict order, conflict may occur between waiting customers
* Although some restaurants have allocated areas where waiting customers can stay, 
many restaurants lack such space, which makes it hard for potential customers to wait
